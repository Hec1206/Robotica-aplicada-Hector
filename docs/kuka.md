# Forward Kinematics for KUKA AN UR ROBOT #

## Introduction

In this project, we performed the forward kinematics analysis of two industrial robots available at our university laboratory:

-KUKA Industrial Robot
-Universal Robots (UR) Collaborative Robot

The objective was to determine the position and orientation of the end-effector using Denavit–Hartenberg (DH) parameters and homogeneous transformation matrices. Forward kinematics allows us to calculate the pose of the robot’s tool based on the joint variables.

## General Description

The **KUKA robot** is a 6-DOF industrial manipulator designed for high precision and industrial automation tasks such as.

- Tasks
    * Welding
    * Pick and place    
    * Machining
    * Assembly

The Universal **Robot (UR)** is a collaborative robot (cobot) designed to work safely alongside humans.

- Main characteristics
    * 6 DOF
    * Lightweight structure
    * Built-in safety system
    * Easy programming interface
